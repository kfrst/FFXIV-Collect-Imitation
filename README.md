### Description
This project is an imitation of the official web [FFXIV Collect](https://ffxivcollect.com/). This project purpose is to apply the knowledge acquired of React and its environment in an area of one of my favourites hobbies: FFXIV. The owner of FFXIV Collect has an API, open to developers, to obtain almost all same data, related to collections, that is used at FFXIV Collect.

### What you can do

In this project you can do the following things:
- Navigate from "Achievements" to "Survey Records" (Side Menu)
- Filter every list using the filter button or just searching collectables by name
- Navigate to a specific collectable clicking the name from the list / icon on the case of Survey Records
- Mark a collectable as owned using the checkbox available on every list
